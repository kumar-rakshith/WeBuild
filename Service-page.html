                    pleasing and functional environments that cater to the needs and preferences of occupants. Interior
                    designers leverage their creativity, technical expertise, and knowledge of design principles to

                    fixtures, lighting, textiles, and decorative elements. They strive to optimize the layout and flow
                    of a space, ensuring that it not only looks visually appealing but also serves its intended purpose
